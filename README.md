# SnapChat-App
MiniSnap is a Java-based console application that simulates core features of Snapchat. It allows users to create accounts, log in, add friends, send and receive snaps, post and view stories, and edit their bios. Each snap automatically expires after 2 minutes, while stories disappear after 24 hours, mimicking real Snapchat behavior.
